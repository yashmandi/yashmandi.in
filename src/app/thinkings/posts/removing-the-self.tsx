most people chase happiness like its some prize at the end of a long road. better job, more money, perfect relationship, nicer body. but the fact is, we think a lot of our pain is coming from the world. it's not. its coming from inside. from the thing we call "self" or the "ego".

think about it. when you're stressed, what is really stressed? is it you, or is it the story you're telling yourself about who you are and how things should be? you're idea of yourself is stressed.

the ego is basically an imaginary identity we've built up over years. it's the "i'm this kind of person", "i need to look good", "i can't fail because then i'm a failure", "people should treat me this way". it's a collection of thoughts, memories, labels, fears, and wants that feel super real. it's a mental construct, and it defends itself like crazy.

every time life doesn't match that image, the ego freaks out. rejection? ego hurts because "i'm not lovable". mistake at work? ego panics because "i'm supposed to be competent". someone ignores you? ego screams "i'm not important". all that drama, all that suffering, is the ego protecting a picture of itself that isn't even solid.

so what happens when you start removing the self? when you let that grip loosen? people who have tasted ego dissolution, through meditation, psychedelics, deep crisis, or just sudden insight-often describe the same thing. the constant background noise of "me me me" quiets down. and suddenly there's this lightness. peace. even joy that doesn't depend on anything going right. it's not that the problems disappear. bills still need paying, people still act shitty sometimes. but without the ego glued to every situation, the sting is way less. you're not defending an identity anymore. you're just here, experiencing what's happening.

happiness ties right into this. most of people (including me) think real happiness is adding more to the ego (more achievements), more approval. it's the opposite. it's dissolving the boundaries that keep you separate and tense. when the self thins out, what's left is connection. to the moment, to others, to life itself. no more fighting reality to protect a fragile "i".

of course it's not like you flip a switch and the ego vanishes forever. it creeps back. old habits die hard. but even small moments of seeing through it change everything. next time stress hits, try asking: who's actually upset here? is it me, or my idea of me?

most suffering is just the ego defending an imaginary identity. drop that defense, even a little, and happiness isn't something you chase anymore. it's what shows up when the chasing stops. that's the weird beautiful truth. removing the self doesn't make you less. it makes you free.
